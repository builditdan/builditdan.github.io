### Background and General Information
This a sample music site that I built during the foundation portion of my front-end training with [bloc.io](https://bloc.io). It uses Javascript and the jQuery library. It is a responsive design and has some hardcoded music that can be played.

### Design Information
This project uses Javascript and the jQuery library.  I have the base url currently set in the `html` `head` tag currently set to `http://builditdan.github.io/bloc-jams/` so you will need to adjust to run the website locally or elsewhere.

### Highlights on scripts included
* [`Buzz Sound`](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) for playing ding at the end of a timer
* [`jQuery`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for manipulating the DOM, creating animations, and more

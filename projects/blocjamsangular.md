### Github URL
[https://github.com/builditdan/bloc-jams-angular](https://github.com/builditdan/bloc-jams-angular)

### Getting Started

**Clone the Github application**<br>
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

**Install grunt**<br>
[http://gruntjs.com/getting-started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

Run the application using the Gruntfile's `default` task:

```

The default task runs a simple server on port 3000. To view it in a any browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

>Note that unless the application is run [via Live Preview in Brackets](#use-in-brackets-live-preview), the browser will need to be refreshed to view the most recent changes.

### Background and General Information
This is a demo music site that I refactored to use AngularJS during my front-end training with [bloc.io](https://bloc.io).

### Design Information
This project uses AngularJS and the [Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) library to play music. It is a demo site only. It is a responsive site and responds with popup imagery on the home page as you scroll down. It has music controls and a play bar that responds when clicked. It is a good example where controllers, services, and directives are used.

### Highlights on scripts included
* [`Angular`](http://angular-ui.github.io/) for development
* [`UI Router`](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) for angular routing
* [`Buzz Sound`](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) for playing ding at the end of a timer
* [`jQuery`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for manipulating the DOM, creating animations, and more


### Additional comments
Just a demo site, not a fully working music site.

### Disclaimer

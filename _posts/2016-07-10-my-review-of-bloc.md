title: Bloc's Full Stack Training Program
---
I joined the [Bloc Bootcamp program](https://www.bloc.io/) in November 2015 to restart my software development career. While I started my career in software development, my path has included time as an IT leader and most recently, client-facing IT project manager. I’ve enjoyed the twists and turns of my career, but found I  missed the opportunity to solve problems creatively, using software.  It was hacking I was missing.

Early in my career, a friend said something to me that has stuck: ”Always keep your toolbox close at hand”. It meant, if you are in a technical role, keep learning new languages and technologies. I tried to stay current through the years but it became more difficult with the demands of managing projects, resources, and clients. So when I decided to leave my position last year (due to personal family matters), I remembered that piece of advice and realized it was time to add some more tools to my toolbox.

Coming from a application development background, I knew I was interested in web development, specifically Ruby and JavaScript. Talking to friends and doing online research, I discovered online coding bootcamps. Given my personal situation, this was the perfect path for me to update my skills - working at my own pace, in my own space.  

But deciding to go with an online boot camp is one thing. Deciding WHICH boot camp is a whole other story! [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/) helped with my search. I originally  narrowed it down to [Firehose](https://www.thefirehoseproject.com/), [BLOC](https://www.bloc.io/), [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/). I wanted more guidance than a self-pace­­­­d program like Code Academy. I liked Firehose, with their focus on back-end skills and team development. I knew from my own experience how critical these skills are to becoming a well-rounded developer.

In the end, the marketing and promotion quality of Bloc won me over.  During a intro to Bloc webinar, one of the instructors said to me, “what is the point of certification? That does not mean much; what counts is building a portfolio of projects on a source repository like [Github](https://github.com/) and showing that to a potential employer.  That is a much better way to demonstrate your skills.” With their commitment to education, one-on-one mentoring, and ability to help me build my portfolio, I was sold.    

I started the Bloc full-stack course in November 2015 and will be finishing in July 2016.  I started with the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) (RoR) track that was followed by the front-end portion. [Jon Linowes](https://www.bloc.io/mentors/jon-linowes) led me through my Ruby training and [John O’Connor](https://www.bloc.io/mentors/john-o-connor.%20/) through the front-end portion.

I am thrilled  with the experiences and knowledge that both these mentors provided.  They work with this technology every day and have many many years of experience. They were also a great source of information beyond just “how does this work” or “why isn’t it working”.  We discussed things like, “how is this really used in business”, “how did you select that tool”, and so on.  

Jon provided solid corrective guidance through code walkthroughs and helped me when I really got stuck. He had a rich set of experience to draw from to answer my questions. I enjoyed his style and in the end he turned me into a real fan of Ruby.

John was a great cheerleader. He made me feel confident in what I was learning and always had suggestions, expertise, and tips to improve my projects. He would often challenge me to add something else make it more fun (albeit more difficult!)  He knew I would gain so much by getting stuck and ultimately figuring it out on my own or working together as a team.

If you are looking for a mentor, I highly recommend Jon and John.

Bloc’s online tutorials were excellent. Many times, I could have sworn something was wrong with the tutorial and came to realize I missed something. I believe these tutorials have improved over the past few years after speaking with previous graduates.

Each track started with the basics of the lessons, followed by a complete walk-through of how to build an online application. For RoR it was a Reddit clone and Javascript was an online music player. Much of this training was typing in code into your local development platform and running your tests from there. Next up, you pick several projects they recommend to develop with some general guidance. Creating a capstone project is part of the curriculum, as well as job preparation tutorials. The Bloc mentors conduct mock technical interviews which helped me get comfortable with using tools like CodePen or JSBin to write sample code on demand during a video interview session.

I highly recommend Bloc if you can afford it. It’s pricey, and takes a strong commitment and effort on your part...but it is totally worth it.  

Here’s my short list of pros and cons:

**Pros**

- Online and self-paced within a selected track
- Can freeze the program if your schedule changes
- One-on-one mentoring sessions with a person you choose
- Interactive code reviews using technologies like Screenhero
- Gradual build of complexity
- Focus on building a portfolio of your projects
- Ability to build a capstone project of your own
- Proven track record and many reviews online

**Cons**

- Not cheap
- The full stack course can be overwhelming as you go deeper into the program if you don’t have a foundation of knowledge and/or background in development
- No paired-programming or sense of working with other student developers but they do have a great development community with learning and connecting with other Bloc attendees

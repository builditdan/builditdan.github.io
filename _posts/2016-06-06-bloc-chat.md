In working with my mentor [John O'Connor](https://github.com/sax1johno) at [bloc](https://www.bloc.io/), I just finished a chat application using AngularJS. It is a single page web application where you can chat with other users in selected conversations. Below is a screenshot of the initial design below.

I really enjoyed learning about NoSQL by using Firebase and how [binding an array](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/guide/synchronized-arrays.html) works inside Angular controllers.

You can read the details about this project [here](/projects/blocchat.html).

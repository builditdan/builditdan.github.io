I updated a few things on NextMoveIQ.com. My goal was to move away from using Zillow neighborhood data and this is now complete. I have loaded Census data directly into my database.  Database contains over 1/2 million rows of data. Below are a summary of the changes:


+New banner and logo created.

+Added 3 new questions.  One asks about the size of mountains and average snowfall per year.  Those questions better represent the climate and seasons of the year for a particular state.  Many people like to ski or be near mountain(s) for the type of outdoor exploring they offer.  The 3rd question was to show places like parks, beaches, hospitals, etc that are within x miles.  This is helpful if you want to know what amenties are close to you in a particular neighborhood.

+Improved the neighborhood popup screen to scroll with you on the page.

+New information on the neighborhood summary that popups up if clicked for schools, hospitals, parks, trails, and beaches.

+New information on the neighborhood summary that provides google links to various transportation options like bus stops, subways, etc

+Database is now using Census data instead of Zillow so branding was removed.

+Queries for the city and negibhrohhod information speeded up. Site should be a little more peppy.

+New walkthru video posted, check it out at [https://vimeo.com/190763687](https://vimeo.com/190763687).
